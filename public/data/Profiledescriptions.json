  "Hopeful Realist": {
    "tagline": "Not naive. Just not bitter.",
    "description": "You still believe in love, but you’ve stopped romanticizing people who only text you after 10pm. You show up with depth, patience, and a side-eye for red flags. You’ve done the work. You want someone who has too."
  },
  "Gentle Challenger": {
    "tagline": "Soft voice, sharp mind.",
    "description": "You’re kind, but not compliant. You’ll hold a mirror up, but never weaponize it. People come to you for perspective, and you offer it without preaching. You don’t need to be right — you just want real connection."
  },
  "Quiet Flame": {
    "tagline": "Low drama, high depth.",
    "description": "You’re not loud, but you burn steady. You connect with depth, communicate clearly, and don’t flinch from hard feelings. You value peace, but not at the cost of truth. You won’t chase — but you’re unforgettable."

  "Earnest Explorer": {
    "tagline": "Curious, open, and self-aware enough to cringe at your old texts.",
    "description": "You’re always learning, reflecting, adapting. You want to grow *with* someone, not around them. You bring vulnerability without oversharing and curiosity without codependence."
  },
  "Hard-Learned Lover": {
    "tagline": "You’ve met your patterns. Now you make them breakfast and tell them to leave.",
    "description": "You’ve cycled through some things (read: emotionally unregulated chaos), but you’ve learned. You crave depth, but with guardrails. You want safety, but also passion. You’re here for the work — yours and theirs."

  "Introspective Firecracker": {
    "tagline": "Big heart, spicy edge.",
    "description": "You feel deeply, react quickly, and reflect relentlessly. You’ve been labeled ‘a lot,’ but you’re also loyal, expressive, and hilariously honest. You’re learning to pause before setting emotional fireworks."
